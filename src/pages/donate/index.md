### #1. Make a general donation
If you're ready to make a donation to the neediest hospitals and to our community's restaurants, there's no time like now!  Go for it by clicking the donate button!

### #2. Support Restaurants in a Town
Most of our donors just want to help where it's needed most. But some organizers, and some donors, are focused on particular towns. For example, we are working with coordinators in the City of Cambridge to collect donations for Cambridge-based restaurants. These regional partners work through us according to our principles: equitable distribution of orders among the specified region/town's restaurants, equitable distribution of food to hospitals according to need, same requirements of restaurants, etc.

In addition to our general fund for all of the Greater Boston area, we have one town-focused program right now -- for Cambridge. To make a donation specifically for Cambridge, simply enter "Cambridge" in the comment field of the GoFundMe donation form when you click on Donate Now! button, below. Check out our town & regional programs page for more details.

If you want to organize fund-raising and restaurants in a particular town or region, take a look at our town & regional programs page and/or contact us by email at feedthefightboston@gmail.com.

Post, tweet, and tell others about us any way you can!  Encourage them to get involved. Here are some words that might be helpful:

    The staff at our local hospitals are working tirelessly to care for COVID-19 patients - for all of us. Though we can’t repay them with the same kind of care, we can show our appreciation and keep them healthy and strong by providing meals from local restaurants. And as we do that, we can also help those restaurants and their workers as they struggle in these difficult times. Donate to #FeedthefightBoston and together, we'll make a difference in our communities. Check out feedthefightbos.com for more information.


### If you are a restaurant and can donate food:
Although we work to support restaurants with purchases, some restaurants have been able to make contributions. If you are a restaurant able to donate food, thank you! Please contact us at: feedthefightboston@gmail.com
