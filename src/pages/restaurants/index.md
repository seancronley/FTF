Feed the Frontline DMV and its donors are concerned about the well-being of everyone in our communities. With this effort, we are focusing on supporting local restaurants and the workers who make them places that we love.

Any Maryland, Virginia, or Washington D.C. area restaurant can work with us, whether they prepare breakfast, coffee, lunch, dinners, ice cream... you name it. 
Each week Feed The Frontline DMV coordinates with the hospitals to identify where the needs are greatest and to serve the ones fighting COVID-19 as equitably as possible. Our ability to serve them is determined by how much funding we have available for the week. Once we've planned what the orders are, we then spread them as fairly as possible among our affiliated restaurants.
