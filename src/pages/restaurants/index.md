Feed the Frontline DMV and its donors are concerned about the well-being of everyone in our communities. With this effort, we are focusing on supporting local restaurants and the workers who make them places that we love.

Any Maryland, Virginia, or Washington D.C. area restaurant can work with us, whether they prepare breakfast, coffee, lunch, dinners, ice cream... you name it.  That said, there are some requirements.  Restaurants need to be:

    Able to prepare and deliver the individually packaged snacks, meals, etc. that hospitals need;
    Able to prepare orders that are nut-free and do not include pork. This helps keep things simple. While we do not have requirements relating to vegetarian or vegan food, many of our restaurant partners prepare - and clearly mark vegetarian and/or vegan items as part (or sometimes all) of their orders;
    Able to take orders through ezCater.  If they aren't signed up, the process is straightforward.  And signing up and working with ezCater involves no cost to the restaurant;
    Locally owned. We believe that all restaurants and workers deserve our support.  We're focusing our limited resources on those that are locally owned because they generally don't have the resources of larger chains.


Each week Feed The Frontline DMV coordinates with the hospitals to identify where the needs are greatest and to serve the ones fighting COVID-19 as equitably as possible.  Our ability to serve them is determined by how much funding we have available for the week.  Once we've planned what the orders are, we then spread them as fairly as possible among our affiliated restaurants.  No restaurant can count on a particular amount of business, or even any business in any week.  But they all can count on getting their fair share over time.
